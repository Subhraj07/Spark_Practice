Every night! Not sure what or why that is but it was annoying! Once we were in the room we got used to the smell. Not my cup of tea for $250 a night! I know its LA but $40 a night for parking! Really!?! Annoying!! Last, the tv software was horrible! It took like literally a minute to change the channel. So if one channel wasn't what we wanted then we'd have to start over with the whole thing. So annoying!! No clicking the up or down arrows.

       "20   We reserved a room with kitchen and 2 beds and when we arrived they told us we did not and they were not responsible for it so we ended up in a much smaller room. Also the hall was very dirty as was the room. The bath tub even had hair when we arrived. You should definitely check twice before booking here. The parking is 40 dlls per night!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "859  My fiancee and I expected a quiet peaceful getaway and this is why we chose this hotel. Boy were we in for a rude awakening \"literally.\" We stayed there 2 nights, and were rudely awoken by construction going on above us both mornings. Loud banging on the roof that went on all day. Not only that, the bathroom was dirty and uninviting, and there were no cookies as promised upon checkout. talk about false advertisments. finally, the 20 dollars a night parking fee for a cramped parking stall was way too high. We wrote to management saying how unhappy we were with a stay expecting some sort of apology. What we got was no reply at all. We will never stay here again and we recommend you dont either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "568  Be very careful about booking this hotel. Triple check your reservation. We canceled one night, which was a Friday, and the hotel staff canceled the first night which was Wednesday. When we went to check in Wednesday told us they had no reservation, then figured out one night was canceled which was supposed to be Friday, they had no rooms, blamed us for the mix up and the front desk \"guy\" was rude and condescending. Needless to say, we left with no room, and ended up at a Ramada because of a convention in town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8    This hotel has great reviews. However, now that we stayed there here are a few items you might want to consider. Although the staff is nice thats about it. The floor (4th floor) smelled so gross, they had some flowery scent going at night that was so over powering we had to practically run to our room. Once we got into our room it smelled like mildew! Every night! Not sure what or why that is but it was annoying! Once we were in the room we got used to the smell. Not my cup of tea for $250 a night! I know its LA but $40 a night for parking! Really!?! Annoying!! Last, the tv software was horrible! It took like literally a minute to change the channel. So if one channel wasn't what we wanted then we'd have to start over with the whole thing. So annoying!! No clicking the up or down arrows. It was so time consuming we finally just turned it off and went to bed. Ready to get out asap every morning. Bathrooms are tiny. Only plus is that room is big. And room was clean. Other than that it wasn't my cup of tea and we will not be returning.   \n",
       "121  By bad location I mean the neighborhood. It's get very scary at night, especially for a group of girls. But the room was really nice.

       "14   I was very disappointed with my stay at Le Montrose. It wasn't clean - there were multiple pieces of chewed gum on our carpet! The elevator also reeked of marijuana. The walls were thin so it was very noisy. Our balcony looked out over someone's backyard which was very awkward - we didn't even go out there. The pictures online are deceiving. I would not stay here again.A few positive notes: the staff was friendly and the location was convenient to West Hollywood restaurants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "643  First off, it looks like an old apartment building (in fact it is an old apartment building). Not impressive.Pre-paid reservation through Orbitz for (2) nights in a one-bedroom suite. Booked as only (1) night with the hotel. However, front desk staff was helpful.The hotel has a cheap DWR-type interior design that is showing wear and tear. Bad seams in the carpet and wall-coverings. Poor quality workman-ship through-out.One elevator was out the entire time that we were there.Room was not clean. 2 of 3 telephones in the room did not work. The handset on the main phone in our suite was gross. I don't think it had been cleaned in a long time.Mold stains in the shower.Bed bugs in the sofa bed.No bar. Poor food quality. Bad drinks (bloody mary was a low quality mix with brown lemon-slice).Placed (2) wake-up calls for early check-out on last morning. Received (0)! Front desk guy said \"Sorry, my fault\".This is a 2 star place with low quality semi-designer finishes.                                                                                \n",
       "306  Well...where do I start...Upon arrival we were unaware the hotel was under going major construction work...this was also not pointed out by reception. We actually only realised this when the heavily tipped bell boy showed us to our room...dragging our bags over the uncovered concrete floor and plastic covered walls. As you can imagine this was quite an unpleasant surprise considering the hotels room rates are not that of a budget chain. When we eventually got into the room this only lead to further disappointment. There was no bath and the decor was terribly dated. To top this off it appeared the air con generator was right outside our room window...noise pollution all day and night making it very difficult to sleep...that said the bed was comfy. Building work commenced at 10am where we were Rudely awakened by loud banging and noises.

The floor (4th floor) smelled so gross, they had some flowery scent going at night that was so over powering we had to practically run to our room. Once we got into our room it smelled like mildew! Every night! Not sure what or why that is but it was annoying! Once we were in the room we got used to the smell. Not my cup of tea for $250 a night! I know its LA but $40 a night for parking! Really!?! Annoying!! Last, the tv software was horrible! It took like literally a minute to change the channel. So if one channel wasn't what we wanted then we'd have to start over with the whole thing. So annoying!! No clicking the up or down arrows. It was so time consuming we finally just turned it off and went to bed. Ready to get out asap every morning. Bathrooms are tiny. Only plus is that room is big. And room was clean.

       "859  My fiancee and I expected a quiet peaceful getaway and this is why we chose this hotel. Boy were we in for a rude awakening \"literally.\" We stayed there 2 nights, and were rudely awoken by construction going on above us both mornings. Loud banging on the roof that went on all day. Not only that, the bathroom was dirty and uninviting, and there were no cookies as promised upon checkout. talk about false advertisments. finally, the 20 dollars a night parking fee for a cramped parking stall was way too high. We wrote to management saying how unhappy we were with a stay expecting some sort of apology. What we got was no reply at all. We will never stay here again and we recommend you dont either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "568  Be very careful about booking this hotel. Triple check your reservation. We canceled one night, which was a Friday, and the hotel staff canceled the first night which was Wednesday. When we went to check in Wednesday told us they had no reservation, then figured out one night was canceled which was supposed to be Friday, they had no rooms, blamed us for the mix up and the front desk \"guy\" was rude and condescending. Needless to say, we left with no room, and ended up at a Ramada because of a convention in town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8    This hotel has great reviews. However, now that we stayed there here are a few items you might want to consider. Although the staff is nice thats about it. The floor (4th floor) smelled so gross, they had some flowery scent going at night that was so over powering we had to practically run to our room. Once we got into our room it smelled like mildew! Every night! Not sure what or why that is but it was annoying! Once we were in the room we got used to the smell. Not my cup of tea for $250 a night! I know its LA but $40 a night for parking! Really!?! Annoying!! Last, the tv software was horrible! It took like literally a minute to change the channel. So if one channel wasn't what we wanted then we'd have to start over with the whole thing. So annoying!! No clicking the up or down arrows. It was so time consuming we finally just turned it off and went to bed. Ready to get out asap every morning. Bathrooms are tiny. Only plus is that room is big. And room was clean. Other than that it wasn't my cup of tea and we will not be returning.   \n",

The walls were thin so it was very noisy. Our balcony looked out over someone's backyard which was very awkward - we didn't even go out there. The pictures online are deceiving.

Bad seams in the carpet and wall-coverings. Poor quality workman-ship through-out.One elevator was out the entire time that we were there.Room was not clean. 2 of 3 telephones in the room did not work.

       "306  Well...where do I start...Upon arrival we were unaware the hotel was under going major construction work...this was also not pointed out by reception. We actually only realised this when the heavily tipped bell boy showed us to our room...dragging our bags over the uncovered concrete floor and plastic covered walls. As you can imagine this was quite an unpleasant surprise considering the hotels room rates are not that of a budget chain. When we eventually got into the room this only lead to further disappointment. There was no bath and the decor was terribly dated. To top this off it appeared the air con generator was right outside our room window...noise pollution all day and night making it very difficult to sleep...that said the bed was comfy. Building work commenced at 10am where we were Rudely awakened by loud banging and noises.

They then denied that they had told us it would be ready then. It was snowing out and we would have never trudged our way there if they had not told us it was ready. The reception area is very cold an uncomfortable and not the type of place you would ever want to spend any time. But my reall issue was the terrible terrible customer service. There are many choices of hotels and it would be tought ot ever go back. I was so so sorry we had prepaid for our room as I no longer wanted to stay there. Again very very rude, almost obnoxious and it was with GLEE that after our making it there in a snow storm that she said check in is not until 3 althought she adnmitted saying the room would be ready at 1.

I figured i would deal with my credit card company to get a refund, but the only other reason for the 1 star is that when we left he just said he's cancel our reservation and there would be no charge.

The staff uses the same elevators as the guests which must slow it down even more, and it is not a pleasant experience to be crammed in an elevator with a cart full of dirty laundry. They do not change the linen daily either. The \"lobby\" could barely be called a room, and the breakfast room which was connected to it had some sort of coffee vending machine in the corner.

But still, this is absolutely the worst hotel and unhappiest experience I have encountered during thirty years of traveling. Let me explain....The problem is the staff. They aren't just indifferent, lazy, and downright dumb. They're antagonist boring on hostile (Me: 'Could I have change for a twenty?' Deskclerk: 'No change.' Me: 'What?' Deskclerk: 'No change. We don't give change. Go to the drugstore.' Me: 'Hummmm.') In a five day stay not one single staff member lifted a finger to assist with anything or provide any information. Indeed, they seemed barely willing to acknowledge the existence of the guests who looked to them for at least minimal service. Do you believe another deskclerk really didn't know how the taxis charge for rides in DC under the local zone system? Do you believe housekeeping really didn't know when laundry had to be collected in the morning? Do you really believe that no one knew where the (one) bellman was when we need luggage service? No, neither do I.Other than the sheer unpleasantness of dealing with these people, the most unfortunate result of their hostility to their jobs is that the hotel's maintenance standard is terrible. When we were there virtually everything seemed to be broken (air conditioning, internet service, coffee maker). Forget about getting it fixed. Forget about anybody even caring that it's broken. And absolutely forget about anyone saying 'I'm sorry.'There is a nasty undercurrent to staying this hotel that leaves a really bad taste. The staff clearly hates their jobs and the guests more or less equally. Unless for some reason you prefer a dolop of confrontation and and a dab of something like class warfare with your hotel stays, I'd suggest you go someplace else. These people are scary.</td>\n",

       "140  These suites are well located en Geogetown within walking distance of everything . Very tired, air compressor for the heating was very noisy, to the point it disturbs your sleep. Also, very bad pressure in the shower. With very little expense could be improved dramatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "298  I have not been to a hotel or establishment recvently where the check in peron was so extremely rude!!! My husband called ahead to ask wha time the room would be ready and after being told thqt it owuld be ready at 1:30 and to come then when we arrived it was not ready. They then denied that they had told us it would be ready then. It was snowing out and we would have never trudged our way there if they had not told us it was ready. The reception area is very cold an uncomfortable and not the type of place you would ever want to spend any time. But my reall issue was the terrible terrible customer service. There are many choices of hotels and it would be tought ot ever go back. I was so so sorry we had prepaid for our room as I no longer wanted to stay there. Again very very rude, almost obnoxious and it was with GLEE that after our making it there in a snow storm that she said check in is not until 3 althought she adnmitted saying the room would be ready at 1. A horrible horrible start to a stay. They need to get rid of Benzina as soon as they can!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "432  Worst hotel i've ever checked into. 1 star for location only. Dirty, poorly lit and felt unsafe. There was no one behind the check in counter when we arrived. A guy slowly walked over from a tv in the lobby to check us in. He was rude. When we finally went up to our room, it stunk. Like an old mildewy stench. the room looked NOTHING at all like the pictures on the website. False advertising! We stayed for 10 mins. and then literally checked out. I figured i would deal with my credit card company to get a refund, but the only other reason for the 1 star is that when we left he just said he's cancel our reservation and there would be no charge. And the price i had was by no means a bargain.

       "664  I will not be going back to this hotel ever. It would be a much better value to stay at a holiday inn or some other chain. The room was dirty and the bathroom was merely tolerable. The kitchen in the room was horribly disgusting, and the fixtures looked dirty. Additionally, the elevators are excruciatingly slow. I waited for nearly 10 full minutes once for the elevators. The staff uses the same elevators as the guests which must slow it down even more, and it is not a pleasant experience to be crammed in an elevator with a cart full of dirty laundry. They do not change the linen daily either. The \"lobby\" could barely be called a room, and the breakfast room which was connected to it had some sort of coffee vending machine in the corner. Very unpleasant experience altogether that I would never recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2    There is a class of DC hotel that caters to families. The room was large with a kitchen. The layout was awkward, the desk chair had not arms and thus not comfortable for working, the bathroom like that in a interstate chain hotel. While nothing was horrible lots of small things need work (a towel rack fell off while I was there). It is not well suited to business travelers. One major annoyance: when I asked about cabs I got inconsistent information and in the end when they called for one they sent a gypsy. A respectable hotel should not subject their guests to these illegal, overpriced services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "749  It's a shame really. The location is great, the rooms are adequate, and the price isn't bad. But still, this is absolutely the worst hotel and unhappiest experience I have encountered during thirty years of traveling. Let me explain....The problem is the staff. They aren't just indifferent, lazy, and downright dumb. They're antagonist boring on hostile (Me: 'Could I have change for a twenty?' Deskclerk: 'No change.' Me: 'What?' Deskclerk: 'No change. We don't give change. Go to the drugstore.' Me: 'Hummmm.') In a five day stay not one single staff member lifted a finger to assist with anything or provide any information. Indeed, they seemed barely willing to acknowledge the existence of the guests who looked to them for at least minimal service. Do you believe another deskclerk really didn't know how the taxis charge for rides in DC under the local zone system? Do you believe housekeeping really didn't know when laundry had to be collected in the morning? Do you really believe that no one knew where the (one) bellman was when we need luggage service? No, neither do I.Other than the sheer unpleasantness of dealing with these people, the most unfortunate result of their hostility to their jobs is that the hotel's maintenance standard is terrible. When we were there virtually everything seemed to be broken (air conditioning, internet service, coffee maker). Forget about getting it fixed. Forget about anybody even caring that it's broken. And absolutely forget about anyone saying 'I'm sorry.'There is a nasty undercurrent to staying this hotel that leaves a really bad taste. The staff clearly hates their jobs and the guests more or less equally. Unless for some reason you prefer a dolop of confrontation and and a dab of something like class warfare with your hotel stays, I'd suggest you go someplace else. These people are scary.   \n",

They then denied that they had told us it would be ready then. It was snowing out and we would have never trudged our way there if they had not told us it was ready. The reception area is very cold an uncomfortable and not the type of place you would ever want to spend any time. But my reall issue was the terrible terrible customer service. There are many choices of hotels and it would be tought ot ever go back. I was so so sorry we had prepaid for our room as I no longer wanted to stay there. Again very very rude, almost obnoxious and it was with GLEE that after our making it there in a snow storm that she said check in is not until 3 althought she adnmitted saying the room would be ready at 1.

I figured i would deal with my credit card company to get a refund, but the only other reason for the 1 star is that when we left he just said he's cancel our reservation and there would be no charge.

The staff uses the same elevators as the guests which must slow it down even more, and it is not a pleasant experience to be crammed in an elevator with a cart full of dirty laundry. They do not change the linen daily either. The \"lobby\" could barely be called a room, and the breakfast room which was connected to it had some sort of coffee vending machine in the corner.

       "      <td>Passamos um mês no hotel ao nos mudarmos para Washington DC. O tapete fede e o cheiro infesta o apartamento inteiro. A limpeza é simbólica, todos os dias a faxineira vinha para \"fazer o menos possível\", o quarto estava sempre sujo, o aspirador era passado apenas pelas áreas centrais. O café da manhã é medíocre. Há dois pontos fortes, o primeiro é a localização e o segundo é o atendimento na recepção e administração do hotel. Agradeço à gentileza do Sr Miguel, da Srta Teara e da Sra Mareesha.</td>\n",

       "298  I have not been to a hotel or establishment recvently where the check in peron was so extremely rude!!! My husband called ahead to ask wha time the room would be ready and after being told thqt it owuld be ready at 1:30 and to come then when we arrived it was not ready. They then denied that they had told us it would be ready then. It was snowing out and we would have never trudged our way there if they had not told us it was ready. The reception area is very cold an uncomfortable and not the type of place you would ever want to spend any time. But my reall issue was the terrible terrible customer service. There are many choices of hotels and it would be tought ot ever go back. I was so so sorry we had prepaid for our room as I no longer wanted to stay there. Again very very rude, almost obnoxious and it was with GLEE that after our making it there in a snow storm that she said check in is not until 3 althought she adnmitted saying the room would be ready at 1. A horrible horrible start to a stay. They need to get rid of Benzina as soon as they can!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "432  Worst hotel i've ever checked into. 1 star for location only. Dirty, poorly lit and felt unsafe. There was no one behind the check in counter when we arrived. A guy slowly walked over from a tv in the lobby to check us in. He was rude. When we finally went up to our room, it stunk. Like an old mildewy stench. the room looked NOTHING at all like the pictures on the website. False advertising! We stayed for 10 mins. and then literally checked out. I figured i would deal with my credit card company to get a refund, but the only other reason for the 1 star is that when we left he just said he's cancel our reservation and there would be no charge. And the price i had was by no means a bargain. It was $315/ night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "664  I will not be going back to this hotel ever. It would be a much better value to stay at a holiday inn or some other chain. The room was dirty and the bathroom was merely tolerable. The kitchen in the room was horribly disgusting, and the fixtures looked dirty. Additionally, the elevators are excruciatingly slow. I waited for nearly 10 full minutes once for the elevators. The staff uses the same elevators as the guests which must slow it down even more, and it is not a pleasant experience to be crammed in an elevator with a cart full of dirty laundry. They do not change the linen daily either. The \"lobby\" could barely be called a room, and the breakfast room which was connected to it had some sort of coffee vending machine in the corner. Very unpleasant experience altogether that I would never recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2    There is a class of DC hotel that caters to families. The room was large with a kitchen. The layout was awkward, the desk chair had not arms and thus not comfortable for working, the bathroom like that in a interstate chain hotel. While nothing was horrible lots of small things need work (a towel rack fell off while I was there). It is not well suited to business travelers. One major annoyance: when I asked about cabs I got inconsistent information and in the end when they called for one they sent a gypsy. A respectable hotel should not subject their guests to these illegal, overpriced services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "749  It's a shame really. The location is great, the rooms are adequate, and the price isn't bad. But still, this is absolutely the worst hotel and unhappiest experience I have encountered during thirty years of traveling. Let me explain....The problem is the staff. They aren't just indifferent, lazy, and downright dumb. They're antagonist boring on hostile (Me: 'Could I have change for a twenty?' Deskclerk: 'No change.' Me: 'What?' Deskclerk: 'No change. We don't give change. Go to the drugstore.' Me: 'Hummmm.') In a five day stay not one single staff member lifted a finger to assist with anything or provide any information. Indeed, they seemed barely willing to acknowledge the existence of the guests who looked to them for at least minimal service. Do you believe another deskclerk really didn't know how the taxis charge for rides in DC under the local zone system? Do you believe housekeeping really didn't know when laundry had to be collected in the morning? Do you really believe that no one knew where the (one) bellman was when we need luggage service? No, neither do I.Other than the sheer unpleasantness of dealing with these people, the most unfortunate result of their hostility to their jobs is that the hotel's maintenance standard is terrible. When we were there virtually everything seemed to be broken (air conditioning, internet service, coffee maker). Forget about getting it fixed. Forget about anybody even caring that it's broken. And absolutely forget about anyone saying 'I'm sorry.'There is a nasty undercurrent to staying this hotel that leaves a really bad taste. The staff clearly hates their jobs and the guests more or less equally. Unless for some reason you prefer a dolop of confrontation and and a dab of something like class warfare with your hotel stays, I'd suggest you go someplace else. These people are scary.   \n",
       "815  Passamos um mês no hotel ao nos mudarmos para Washington DC. O tapete fede e o cheiro infesta o apartamento inteiro. A limpeza é simbólica, todos os dias a faxineira vinha para \"fazer o menos possível\", o quarto estava sempre sujo, o aspirador era passado apenas pelas áreas centrais. O café da manhã é medíocre. Há dois pontos fortes, o primeiro é a localização e o segundo é o atendimento na recepção e administração do hotel. Agradeço à gentileza do Sr Miguel, da Srta Teara e da Sra Mareesha.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "1425  This is hardly a resort. Just bc it is near the bay and has a pool does NOT make it a resort. It was filthy and the food was awful. The kids said the pool was cold. Very disappointed. As Diamond Hilton Honors members, I expect a certain level of care.

       "683   The property is more like a 2 star resort.The grounds were not maintained well and pool was disgusting.

       "2169  I'm 3 days into a 4 day stay here and I'm very disappointed with this hotel. Tried to get help several times the desk girls were very rude. The concierge starts at 10 and finished before 5. Haven't seen her yet and it's been 3 days. No wifi in rooms unless you want to sit out in the cold foyer at the front. Car parking was more expensive than the car rental! Hotel isn't close yo anything except sea world!
