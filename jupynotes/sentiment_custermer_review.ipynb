Clean, good-sized bathrooms, comfortable beds, and plenty of electric and USB outlets. In the morning, at the lobby, there was a nice set-up for breakfast with plenty of places to sit, including nice outside tables. Breakfast had a variety of choices and was good to have included in the hotel rate. During breakfast, nice concierge, Donna, was offering guests interesting tips what to see and visit on the island.

Not having stayed here before, we did not know exactly what to expect since the price was less than most other hotels in the Key West area. However, when searching through several web sites I found most reviews rated it 8 out 10 or better so we went ahead and booked it. Check-in was not a problem though the particular manager we worked with was not the type of warm out-going person you should find at the front desk of a major hotel chain. Checking out two days later was a different story as that desk manager had all of the attributes you hope to find in someone with that responsibility. We reserved rooms with single king size beds and were very happy with what we found. The rooms are very large with recently updated bathrooms (having large walk-in showers was very much appreciated), relatively quite room air conditioners with easy to use controls, large desk with multiple plugins on a power strip for all electronic needs, microwave, refrigerator and other small amenities. The beds were as good as the one I sleep on at home so we were pleased with the accommodations. The hotel is designed around a really nice heated pool and patio area that is easily accessible from all rooms. The patio around the pool has an abundance of comfortable seating areas with tables and chairs as well as several cabanas that have drapes on all sides for privacy or to just keep the wind out. There also a small bar offering various types of beverages. The only minor negative I found was that they lock up the entire pool and patio area at 10:00 pm and that means you also have no access to the only ice machine in the hotel after lockup. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone visiting Key West.</td>\n",

The hotel can range from 100.00 to 1000.000 a night and more I'm sure . \\nWe were looking for a clean place that was priced reasonable. We came across the Fairfield in , it about 2 miles from all the action but the hotel is great . We got a a room for 116.00 a night plus tax for a king size bed . (It's off season at the moment and there were some deals out there . )\\nIt's a very nice property super clean , the reception staff was warm and friendly and checked us in right away . \\nThe room was big with a nice modern feel . Nice glass shower with big towels . The pool area was clean and big with towels . \\nWe had a couple of drinks by the pool where a very friendly bar tender named Ines gave us some pretty nice drinks . Not cheap but strong . \\nEasy to park on the property (free parking ) wi-fi. \\nThe room was very quite and had a great nights sleep , on the nice pillows and down comforter . \\nPlus to top it all off a complementary breakfast buffet . Very happy with the stay .</td>\n",

The pool and grounds were lovely, but the pool area was not cleaned once during our stay and the rooms were disappointing and a little shabby.

Breakfast was bountiful with a wide variety of hot and cold foods. It is the same everyday so if you were to have an extended stay breakfast may become monotonous. We did have an issue with a taxi driver who we called the front desk to arrange for us. Although the hotel had no control over the AWFUL service provided by yellow cab I did file a complaint with the front desk about who they allowed to sit on their property to service their guests.

Seemed like a good value overall relative to other choices we searched for in the area.\\n\\nRoom was clean and in good shape, maybe a little small. Would have liked a table and chair but you just get a desk and chair. Bathroom is large. We were in the building next to the pool but on the parking lot side…I would strongly recommend the pool side if you can get it. This is “motel” style with the doors opening up to an exterior walkway…the walkway is very hot with all the air conditioning units dumping heat onto the walkway…then add the afternoon sun…yowza!!\\n\\nThe pool is a really nice space with lots of great seating including cabanas. It is right on the highway but pretty well broken up trees and shrubs. The water was actually refreshing the 1st day, but the next 2 days it seemed liked they had turned the heat on? Sort of weird but maybe it is just our perception? There is a bar with a bar tender part time…I think he quits at 6 or 7pm? There is a happy hour…it seemed like the drinks were sort of plain and generic. No cherry in my Pina Colada (should that be a Jimmy Buffet song?) or garnishes of any kind in any drink…did not really like my Pina Colada for some reason? My wife could not finish her drink…maybe a Key West Lemonade or something like that. Still it was a good place to hang out and relax after a long day downtown or at Dry Tortugas.\\n\\nBreakfast was average for your typical complimentary hotel breakfast. Fresh fruit was good on 2 days, 1 day they were out but maybe it was there earlier in the morning. I would try to get to breakfast by 830 am or else it may get crowded.\\n\\nLocation and transportation: because you are out of the downtown area you need to plan for this. Uber is prohibited in Key West, that’s right, NO UBER. We have really gotten used to that service and were somewhat put off by this surprise. You can drive into town and pay to park in city parking decks, about 13$ a day, but will probably want to rent bikes or pay for other rides as well because the area is really too big to walk if you really want to see some diversity. There is a shuttle from the hotel $20 a day per room…it runs on the hour and sometimes the ½ hour…it works ok but there is some weirdness and difficultly due to scheduling. You can rent bikes from the hotel and ride downtown. You can get a cab. We did the shuttle one day, and rented bikes while in town. Having bikes while in town is a big plus…I would say this is the way to get around so maybe renting bikes from the hotel would work well? A bit of a ride maybe 3 miles?\\n\\nThere is a concierge in the lobby who was nice and helpful hooking us up with some good bike rentals in town at a discount. She can give you discounts on other attractions as well. We did not have a lot of interaction with the rest of the staff but when we did all were polite.\\n\\nMy wife used the workout room and the laundry room, both were convenient and adequate.\\n\\nIf we go back to Key West in the future I may lean toward paying up to stay in the downtown area. Consider a facility that includes parking so you can park your car and forget about it…then just rent bikes to get around. I guess you need to consider value for services here a little more carefully than in other places we have traveled. The hotels downtown are significantly more $.\\n\\nHaving said all of that Key West was a lot of fun, the only really bad part was coming home!</td>\n",

Lovely big room, coffee machine, fridge, huge TV, lovely big bathroom and excellent toiletries.

The bed was really comfortable and great shower. On check out once again the young man who we saw the day previous and another man, asked about our stay and if we'd enjoyed it, just really nice friendly guys.

However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!  \n",

We made reservations late in our planning and selected this hotel by default. To our surprise it was lovely. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms and grounds were clean and well attended. The pool area was lovely. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples and families.  \n",

It was awesome! Clean. Good breakfast, the pool is nice and relaxing. Service is great. It's 10-15 minutes by car from Duval street and main attractions.  \n",

It is an old- fashioned style motel with individual units built around the pool. The features and amenities could use some updating & enhancement - but the rooms are adequate. A full buffet breakfast is included - adequate. Shuttle service is available to downtown for an extra fee.  \n",

Not only did the front desk clerk have issues with finding our second room reservation, but he also acted as if it was our fault. Finally, after the reservation was found, he made no apologies and just abruptly directed us to our rooms.\\nThe rooms were small, as to be expected from a hotel in Key West, but the set-up and design were very smart for the small space We had everything we needed for an overnight stay. Clean, good-sized bathrooms, comfortable beds, and plenty of electric and USB outlets. In the morning, at the lobby, there was a nice set-up for breakfast with plenty of places to sit, including nice outside tables. Breakfast had a variety of choices and was good to have included in the hotel rate. During breakfast, nice concierge, Donna, was offering guests interesting tips what to see and visit on the island. At that moment, we were reminded of a nice cruise atmosphere. Overall, besides being pricey, and a hitch in the beginning, this hotel was convenient and a good overnight stay.  \n",

Happened to be a spring break week. Unit was clean, staff kept the place quiet and wouldn't have know there were younger people there. Breakfast was fair as expected . Coffee was good but eggs not so much. Staff very helpful, Newer front end person Angel was very nice and helpful to us. Very personable. Only drawback was I think they could have a free shuttle run 3-4 times a day to take people downtown as this location is on the other end of the island.  \n",

Our room stunk, I woke up with a sore throat after breathing the stale air all night, and we ended up with insect bites on us. Also, you must pay extra for a shuttle to downtown. I was awakened at 4am by two guests in a screaming match outside. I will never stay at this hotel again. They need major improvements.  \n",

Also the breakfast was just so so.. best part was the pool and a great bartender who was very friendly and nice.  \n",

Nice room with very comfortable bed. Nice breakfast room with hot breakfast. Pool area has a bar and a Happy Hour. The shuttle to downtown was not free but inexpensive compared to the price to park downtown IF you are even able to find a parking place!!!  \n",

The staff was amazing and very cooperative. Rooms were modern, spacious, clean, and new. I really enjoyed the location, staff, and the free breakfast. Special thanks to Angel, for making our stay the best Key West stay ever!  \n",

When I went into the bathroom I saw the toilet paper rolls one was the brown cardboard roll (no paper) the other was half a roll with the paper hanging down. Also there was bath soap. This made me wonder if the bed sheets were changed.  \n",

There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was $20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great.

I'm sure this was purchased from another chain as it isn't the usual FI. This is a high occupancy quick turnover venue which is an older property. For the price point it is a good value in the Key West market. It was clean and easy to get around. Great pool area. Donna the Concierge was great and very helpful she is a keeper. Breakfast is acceptable but nothing special and closes ON Time so don't go late. Kathy and I both agree that we would here again.  \n",

The sofa bed was so unbelievably uncomfortable that even the children couldn't sleep on it. We had to ask every day for more towels since they didn't get the correct number of towels in the room for us. And the air conditioner was so noisy that it woke us up every time it switched on. When you spend $400 for a room, you expect a little bit more. The breakfast was fantastic and the pool was beautiful, but I think this hotel is really overpriced  \n",

There is a shuttle to the other end of the island, but it is not totally reliable. Fortunately, we discovered Hurricane Hole and Lazy Dog Adventures a short walk across the bridge to Stock Island. We love kayaking in the mangroves and sitting on the dock with a drink watching the pelicans at the marina.  \n",

This specific hotel was a disappointment. It reminded me of everyday motels from 30 years ago. All room entries are from the outside. Our room was next to the road so it was noisier than other Marriotts. There were many rooms that faced an inside area or were away from the frontage road. We arrived very late but called while in route to confirm our reservation.  \n",

The facility is very clean, new or recently updated, and the staff was accommodating and friendly. The pool space is nice and there's a poolside bar. \\n\\nThey have a shuttle that drops you off at Mallory Square for a small fee, it's well worth the $20.00 (2 people for 2 days I think). The sunset's are great there as well as its close to bars and restaurants. The travel time from the Fairfield to the drop off is about 10 minutes and you can avoid driving, parking and Tommy the driver will play some great tunes on your ride!  \n",

Better than expected and priced okay for Key West in the middle of the busy season. Room was quiet and well appointed as you would expect from a Marriott associated hotel.  \n",

We enjoyed the room even though it is not very big. Great pool. Nice continental breakfast. Has a gym but we didn't have time to use it. Parking not far from the room. Need to drive to get downtown. Not walking distance. Can order tickets for a boat ride from the hotel. Recommend this hotel!  \n",

The pool is amazing and the rooms were clean. The staff we very helpful and friendly. It is a great location and a short drive to Duvall Steet. Bar in the pool area was a plus.  \n",

I little tricky to get into the first time as we turned left at the red light and did not see entrance on the right quick enough. Nice hotel. Definitely have to drive downtown and place to experience Key West. Slightly cheaper than some of downtown hotels and quieter. Large breakfast area!  \n",

The hotel was very clean, a very nice pool, and a great breakfast with plenty of seating. This hotel is about 1 1/2 miles from downtown whch was great for us, quiet, reasonably priced, threre is easy access to the Trolley Car shuttle which you can take all over the island. You can purchase the tickets at hotel. The concierge was great, very knowledgeable of the Keys, the restaurants, shops etc. This was our first visit to the Keys and I definitely would stay here again.  \n",

Parking and breakfast were included. Breakfast was good. It is a good hotel the only inconvenient is it's locations as it is far from the main attractions in Key West. They offer shuttle service but they charge for it. When I went there was no uber available at Key West. So if you don't mind having to drive or take a cab to every place it's a perfect hotel.  \n",

However, from the moment we arrived we were impressed by the staff and hotel. Our spacious room (at the far end and facing south) was comfortable, clean and more importantly quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and filling. The only downside is location. It's at the north end of the island and 4 miles from the downtown section.  \n",

Not having stayed here before, we did not know exactly what to expect since the price was less than most other hotels in the Key West area. However, when searching through several web sites I found most reviews rated it 8 out 10 or better so we went ahead and booked it. Check-in was not a problem though the particular manager we worked with was not the type of warm out-going person you should find at the front desk of a major hotel chain. Checking out two days later was a different story as that desk manager had all of the attributes you hope to find in someone with that responsibility. We reserved rooms with single king size beds and were very happy with what we found. The rooms are very large with recently updated bathrooms (having large walk-in showers was very much appreciated), relatively quite room air conditioners with easy to use controls, large desk with multiple plugins on a power strip for all electronic needs, microwave, refrigerator and other small amenities. The beds were as good as the one I sleep on at home so we were pleased with the accommodations. The hotel is designed around a really nice heated pool and patio area that is easily accessible from all rooms. The patio around the pool has an abundance of comfortable seating areas with tables and chairs as well as several cabanas that have drapes on all sides for privacy or to just keep the wind out. There also a small bar offering various types of beverages. The only minor negative I found was that they lock up the entire pool and patio area at 10:00 pm and that means you also have no access to the only ice machine in the hotel after lockup. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone visiting Key West.  \n",

Very noisy on weekend with people walking by room talking loudly and cars reeving engines squealing tires in parking lot. No sleep between 11 pm and 2 am. Tiki bar and swimming pool were nice.  \n",

This is an annual event. We found the weather in FLL to be cloudy, windy and rainy, so we decided to drive to Key West Sunday morning. The drive took about 4 hours and we arrived at 2 p.m. We booked a room at the Fairfield Inn which lies on the outskirts of town about 3 miles from Duval Street. \\n\\nThe hotel seemed clean and the rooms were spacious. Check in was easy and our rooms were on the second floor. There were only two floors.\\n\\nI've always stayed at Marriotts, but never at a Fairfield Inn. The feel is more of a roadside inn than a Marriott, but that could be the layout for all Fairfields.\\n\\nWe dropped our bags and took a cab to watch the games at Charlie O's and The Lazy Gecko. \\n\\nWe got back around 12:30 a.m. The room was fine for sleeping. We had breakfast (Which was a buffet.) in the morning and headed back to Fort Lauderdale. \\n\\nI'm not sure if I would stay at a FI again. I look to the amenities at full service hotels and resorts. But no complaints, :)  \n",

The room was nicely furnished and clean with a large bathroom.\\nThe desk staff was helpful and efficient. The cleaning staff was prompt. The concierge was patient and helpful.\\nThe breakfast included eggs, sausage, waffles, a variety of breads, muffins and cereal. These items were replenished constantly.\\nThe hotel is 4 miles from town so use the shuttle or the trolley. Don't drive! There is a small charge for the shuttle but cheaper than the trolley or taxi. The shuttle covers several hotels so be prepared to wait on busy days.\\nRestaurants are a distance from the hotel so be prepared to walk our use a taxi. We paid as much for a taxi to a restaurant nearby as to get to the hotel from town.  \n",

Our first contact with the hotel was with the receptionist who checked us in and in my experience can give a fair indication of what standards have been set. We were not disappointed as check in was quick, very friendly and informative. We were made to feel welcome straight away and following check in we were referred to the concierge who went to great lengths to answer any questions we had. Our family had 2 double queen adjacent rooms and on seeing that my wife had mobility problems located us on the ground floor. As stated above first impressions are very important and the reception staff were an excellent advert for the hotel. Needless to say I was not surprised that our stay at this hotel was very comfortable,relaxing and enjoyable. The rooms were clean and spacious. The beds were the essence of comfort and the ensuite facilities were faultless. The free breakfast provided a good selection of what the majority of people would normally have and for us was completely satisfactory. The hotel also has a pool and pool bar in very relaxing surroundings complete with poolside chairs and cabanas. This hotel is very conveniently located to downtown Key West and has excellent parking facilities. Also located within minutes are excellent shopping facilities ie K mart, Publix etc. To sum up our stay could not have been more enjoyable and I have no reservations in recommending this hotel as a great place to stay.  \n",

Everyone was helpful and courteous and the breakfast was very good. Ines was our bartender out by the pool and she was awesome!! She helped us with places to go in the area. And she smiles a lot :)  \n",

I used the fitness room & it was great. We saw a great guy at the pool happy hour, Jeff Egelston.\\nI dId have a problem at check-in, but the Manager Bo took care of it for us. Staff was very nice, rooms were clean.  \n",

Arrived and was pleased that we were allowed early check in. I was impressed with the outside decor, each room seemed to have it's own sitting area. However the room left something to be desired, literally there's a sofa bed with a king bed right beside it... the website states separate sitting area... I was disappointed to say the least. The overnight auditor was not authorized to remedy the issue... manager Eric was apologetic and provided new option and this room also had no wall separating the sitting and sleeping areas although the space was more divided. We were compensated with a price adjustment and hung a sheet for privacy. Overall the hotel is acceptable despite being on such a busy street.... but a suite without walls is not a suite @ all  \n",

It's near the top of the Island and away from Duval St and the party madness. This is a very nice hotel, comfortable clean rooms and an excellent staff. They bend over backwards to make sure you enjoy your stay. The flip side of being far away from Old Town is that it's about a $20 cab ride each way. Parking downtown is very limited if you're drinking, you don't want to be driving anyway. All in all it was a really nice place to stay.  \n",

The hotel can range from 100.00 to 1000.000 a night and more I'm sure . \\nWe were looking for a clean place that was priced reasonable. We came across the Fairfield in , it about 2 miles from all the action but the hotel is great . We got a a room for 116.00 a night plus tax for a king size bed . (It's off season at the moment and there were some deals out there . )\\nIt's a very nice property super clean , the reception staff was warm and friendly and checked us in right away . \\nThe room was big with a nice modern feel . Nice glass shower with big towels . The pool area was clean and big with towels . \\nWe had a couple of drinks by the pool where a very friendly bar tender named Ines gave us some pretty nice drinks . Not cheap but strong . \\nEasy to park on the property (free parking ) wi-fi. \\nThe room was very quite and had a great nights sleep , on the nice pillows and down comforter . \\nPlus to top it all off a complementary breakfast buffet . Very happy with the stay .  \n",

The noise was unbelievable and constant! Made worse by a Harley Davidson festival weekend on the island, and racing, loud exhaust-free almost subterranean-rumbling all day and into the night. The pool and grounds were lovely, but the pool area was not cleaned once during our stay and the rooms were disappointing and a little shabby. The noise made it impossible to enjoy a time by the pool. To be fair, the majority of the 'hotels' on the Key and actually 'motels' and not up to European or Caribbean standards. Breakfast was included and bikes could be hired directly on site and there was a shuttle bus across the island to Duval Street where everything happens.  \n",

All there is to say is not stay unless you want a old smelly dirty room with a loud rusty air conditioning!! Marriott should think about removing its affiliates with this hotel  \n",

My wife is a bit of a travel snob so when we arrive she scoffed at the \"down and out\" as she refers to them. This means the hotel room doors have direct access to outside. At check in they gave us a complimentary bottle of wine to welcome us and congratulate us on the milestone. Check in was quick and easy. It is a sprawling property so our room was not near the lobby where breakfast is served but did ope up to a cozy courtyard where you could not tell you were next to a busy street. The room was clean, well appointed, large and the bed very comfortable. We did not use any of the pool facilities (too hot for me) however they do have private cabanas, poolside bar and live entertainment. Breakfast was bountiful with a wide variety of hot and cold foods. It is the same everyday so if you were to have an extended stay breakfast may become monotonous. We did have an issue with a taxi driver who we called the front desk to arrange for us. Although the hotel had no control over the AWFUL service provided by yellow cab I did file a complaint with the front desk about who they allowed to sit on their property to service their guests. All I can say is use KEY LIME taxi, ask for Skip. Check out was smooth and our weekend was over. I would definitely return to this hotel even though the \"action\" is on the opposite side of the island its an easy 4 miles to reach  \n",

The trolley train will bring you to downtown Key West where you can watch the most beautiful sunset you have ever seen at Mallory Square! Breakfast at the hotel is complimentary and very good. The pool looks very nice. The (pool)bartender Stephen is the best and nicest person ever! We had such great chats with him! Please send him our regards (from the couple from the Netherlands)!  \n",

Check in was quick and easy. Free breakfast was good. We ate it both days and there was always plenty. Jamie at the concierge desk was very helpful. We rented bikes which were inexpensive and fun despite the fact that most of us hasn't ridden bikes since childhood. The bikes did seem kind of shaky and untuned if that's a thing but we all survived. \\nThe bed was comfy and the room was clean. The pool area was awesome. I'd stay here again.  \n",

My party of three, all over 65, were treated very well with one exception. My sister took a couple of postcards and went to the concierge to ask about the cost to send and where to mail. This lady who was middle aged or older NEVER LOOKED UP FROM HER PHONE! She said I guess the post office would know and said nothing else! Breakfast was cold every day and chaotic.  \n",

The trolley train will bring you to downtown Key West! Sunset at Mallory Square is amazing! Breakfast at hotel is complimentary and very good. The pool looks very nice. The pool bartender Stephen is the best and nicest person ever! We had great chats with him! Please send him our regards (from the couple from the Netherlands).  \n",

The bathroom was large, the room we had had 2 queen beds with a chair and desk. This was a good size for 2 people. The only issue I had is the drapes. They had regular drapes that only covered half of the window, and a sheer drape that covered the whole window. The problem is at night, there was always light shinning through the window. Not the easiest to get to sleep. The pool and pool area were very nice, they had cabanas and plenty of seating areas.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the free breakfast, something for everyone. They had scrambled eggs (which I think were powdered), hard boiled eggs, sausage, waffles, oatmeal, cereals, breads, english muffins, muffins, yogart, bagels, fresh fruit and fruit salad. Went back for numerous servings.\\n\\nThere was free wi-fi, however they try repeatedly to have you upgrade to a faster speed (for a fee of course).\\n\\nAs far as location, you should either have a car so you can get to the beach or other attractions, or be prepared to catch the trolley or taxi. Not much in walking distance.  \n",

So securing a Hotel 3 months in advance truly worked in Our Favor ! \\n\\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening after spending the Day swimming with the Dolphins at The Dolphin Research Center in Marathon ! That's a Check off my Wife's Bucket List ! So worth the energy and money spent seeing her smile ear to ear ! The staff there are very informative .\\n\\nBack to the Staff and their Secrets ! \\nThe Fairfield Inn and Suites have Personnel that care about your comfort and ensure your needs within their ability are met .\\n\\nThey will recommend the best restaurants , they will share the Best places for Happy Hour , ( 2-7pm are 50% off drinks and appetizers ) So fill up and drink up , \\n\\nHowever for The Best Happy Hour on Key West ! Stay put and Go Pool Side ! They open at 2pm and stay open till 7pm or maybe 9pm . I believe we meet Ben a Bartender who made a Delicious Cocktail that after 2 you may want to call a cab if planning on a Duval Crawl ! Just saying ....\\n\\nAsk or let the concierge know what your interest are and what you would like to do .

Quiet. Up to date. Free breakfast. Cheap room from hotwire. I paid 130 including all fees. Breakfast was ok.Nothing fantastic but not terrible. I have to write 200 letters to fill this up...blah blah blah  \n",
       "105  Stayed here 3 nights with my family of 4 on a 1 week vacation in the Keys. Seemed like a good value overall relative to other choices we searched for in the area.\\n\\nRoom was clean and in good shape, maybe a little small. Would have liked a table and chair but you just get a desk and chair. Bathroom is large. We were in the building next to the pool but on the parking lot side…I would strongly recommend the pool side if you can get it. This is “motel” style with the doors opening up to an exterior walkway…the walkway is very hot with all the air conditioning units dumping heat onto the walkway…then add the afternoon sun…yowza!!\\n\\nThe pool is a really nice space with lots of great seating including cabanas. It is right on the highway but pretty well broken up trees and shrubs. The water was actually refreshing the 1st day, but the next 2 days it seemed liked they had turned the heat on? Sort of weird but maybe it is just our perception? There is a bar with a bar tender part time…I think he quits at 6 or 7pm? There is a happy hour…it seemed like the drinks were sort of plain and generic. No cherry in my Pina Colada (should that be a Jimmy Buffet song?) or garnishes of any kind in any drink…did not really like my Pina Colada for some reason? My wife could not finish her drink…maybe a Key West Lemonade or something like that. Still it was a good place to hang out and relax after a long day downtown or at Dry Tortugas.\\n\\nBreakfast was average for your typical complimentary hotel breakfast. Fresh fruit was good on 2 days, 1 day they were out but maybe it was there earlier in the morning. I would try to get to breakfast by 830 am or else it may get crowded.\\n\\nLocation and transportation: because you are out of the downtown area you need to plan for this. Uber is prohibited in Key West, that’s right, NO UBER. We have really gotten used to that service and were somewhat put off by this surprise. You can drive into town and pay to park in city parking decks, about 13$ a day, but will probably want to rent bikes or pay for other rides as well because the area is really too big to walk if you really want to see some diversity. There is a shuttle from the hotel $20 a day per room…it runs on the hour and sometimes the ½ hour…it works ok but there is some weirdness and difficultly due to scheduling. You can rent bikes from the hotel and ride downtown. You can get a cab. We did the shuttle one day, and rented bikes while in town. Having bikes while in town is a big plus…I would say this is the way to get around so maybe renting bikes from the hotel would work well? A bit of a ride maybe 3 miles?\\n\\nThere is a concierge in the lobby who was nice and helpful hooking us up with some good bike rentals in town at a discount. She can give you discounts on other attractions as well. We did not have a lot of interaction with the rest of the staff but when we did all were polite.\\n\\nMy wife used the workout room and the laundry room, both were convenient and adequate.\\n\\nIf we go back to Key West in the future I may lean toward paying up to stay in the downtown area. Consider a facility that includes parking so you can park your car and forget about it…then just rent bikes to get around. I guess you need to consider value for services here a little more carefully than in other places we have traveled. The hotels downtown are significantly more $.\\n\\nHaving said all of that Key West was a lot of fun, the only really bad part was coming home!  \n",

Right from the minute we parked up we knew this was going to be a good hotel. Young man on reception (think he was from Belgium?) was so nice, friendly and helpful. We went to our room, which we were able to park right outside, which was handy. Lovely big room, coffee machine, fridge, huge TV, lovely big bathroom and excellent toiletries. When I booked I like that there was continental breakfast, in fact, it was far more than a continental breakfast, there were sausage and scrambled eggs, you could make your own pancakes and waffled, fresh fruit juice, selection of pastries, breads, bagels etc. cream cheese, butter, jam, peanut butter to mention just a few of the toppings available, fruit and yogurts and really good coffee. The bed was really comfortable and great shower. On check out once again the young man who we saw the day previous and another man, asked about our stay and if we'd enjoyed it, just really nice friendly guys. Sadly didn't have time to try the pool out or the amazing sun loungers. Will definitely be going back for a longer stay in the future.  \n",

The rooms are spacious and very clean and the beds ver confortable. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The breakfast is OK, but I would suggest the hotel gives some advice to customers on buffet manners. For instance in self made waffles there was huge line because some people were doing industrial quantities of waffles, that in many cases were left on the table. When it was our turn we did not have any because the mix was over. Not very nice for the guests.  \n",

It was the most quiet and most comfortable place we stayed all along the Keys. The bed was comfortable, the room with spacious, loved the fact that it had a refrigerator and microwave! The pool was hot but still fun to soak in. It was away from Duvall Street, but not far of a drive. My advice to anyone coming to the Keys for the first time, do not rent a car. Get a taxi to your hotel and rent a scooter. It's the easiest way to get around on the island. I would also recommend going to the Dry Tortugas for the day it was amazing!  \n",

We were early, so Nakayla held our luggage until we returned later. We took the trolley downtown which stops at the hotel every hour. A $20.00 charge per room is well worth the money when you see a taxi is $20.00 one way! The room was very comfortable and VERY clean. Housekeeping is doing a great job! If you need help making waffles at the breakfast buffet, ask Melinda, she was was friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. Away from Duval, but quieter at night, and very close to some great beaches.  \n",

Like the Marriott in Miami the night before the room, was clean and tastefully decorated.\\n\\n The morning breakfast had a decent range of food alternatives. Scrambled “eggs”, sausage, waffles, cereal, toast, bagels, etc.\\n\\nUnlike, the previous Marriott, this room at night was dark. The furniture consisted of a bed, side tables, a desk chair and a wall mounted desk. To read you had to sit on the bed or in the desk chair under an LED spotlight mounted on the wall over the desk. (Marriott must have gotten a volume discount on these LED spotlights because there were two of them in the previous Marriott.) The lack of light meant you couldn’t see into the closet or using the coffee maker at night. \\n\\nThe hotel has a bus which people can ride to a sister facility three to four blocks from Duval St. The cost is $20 per room (no matter how many in a room). Cabs to Duval cost $20 one way and parking, if you can find it, is $20 for two hours and $35 for the day.\\n\\n If you like shopping and bar hopping, you’ll like Duval St.  \n",

It is right at the base of the bridge, so it was easy to find. As long as we left turning right (and went around the block if we really wanted to go left), it was easy to get in and out of for our daily activities.\\nThe hot items on the breakfast were the exact same every day, however there are enough other options that you can get variety in your breakfast.  \n",
